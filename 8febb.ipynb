    "\n",
    "Definition: Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object or system. It focuses on what an object does rather than how it does it.\n",
    "Purpose: Simplifies complex systems by breaking them into smaller, manageable parts.\n",
    "Key Concept: It is about creating a blueprint or model.\n",
    "Implementation: Achieved using abstract classes, interfaces, or methods in programming.\n",
    "Example of Abstraction:\n",
    "Suppose you're using a car. You only need to know how to drive it (e.g., accelerate, brake, steer), not how the engine works internally. In programming:\n",

    "2. Encapsulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: Encapsulation is the process of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit (class). It also involves restricting direct access to some of an object's components.\n",
    "Purpose: Protects the data and ensures controlled access through getters and setters.\n",
    "Key Concept: It is about how to protect and manage the data.\n",
    "Implementation: Achieved using access modifiers like private, protected, and public.\n",
    "Example of Encapsulation:\n",
    "Suppose you have a bank account. The account balance is private, and you can only access or modify it through methods (like deposit and withdraw) to ensure data integrity. In programming:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "class BankAccount:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, balance):\n",
    "        self.__balance = balance  # Private attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "    def deposit(self, amount):\n",
    "        if amount > 0:\n",
    "            self.__balance += amount\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            print(\"Invalid deposit amount.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    def withdraw(self, amount):\n",
    "        if 0 < amount <= self.__balance:\n",
    "            self.__balance -= amount\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            print(\"Invalid withdrawal amount.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    def get_balance(self):\n",
    "        return self.__balance\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using the encapsulation\n",
    "account = BankAccount(1000)\n",
    "account.deposit(500)\n",
    "print(account.get_balance())  # Output: 1500\n",
    "account.withdraw(2000)  # Output: Invalid withdrawal amount.\n",
    "Key Differences:\n",
    "Aspect\tAbstraction\tEncapsulation\n",
    "Purpose\tFocuses on hiding implementation details.\tFocuses on hiding data and protecting it.\n",
    "Focus\tWhat an object does.\tHow an object manages its data.\n",
    "Implementation\tAchieved using abstract classes, interfaces, or methods.\tAchieved using access modifiers and methods.\n",
    "Example\tDriving a car without knowing how the engine works.\tProtecting the engine parts under the hood of a car.\n",
    "In summary, abstraction hides complexity by providing a simplified interface, while encapsulation secures and manages access to the data. Both work together to support object-oriented programming principles."

    " No, we cannot create an instance of an abstract class directly in most object-oriented programming languages such as Java, C#, or Python. This limitation exists because:\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose of Abstract Classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstract classes serve as blueprints for other classes. They are designed to provide a base for subclasses to inherit from and implement specific functionality.\n",
    "They often include abstract methods, which are method declarations without implementations. Subclasses are required to provide implementations for these methods.\n",
    "Incomplete Implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstract classes may contain abstract methods that lack implementation. Creating an instance of such a class would lead to a situation where the object has methods with undefined behavior, which is not allowed.\n",
    "Language Restrictions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Many programming languages enforce this rule at the syntax level. For example:\n",
    "In Java: If a class is marked as abstract, you cannot instantiate it directly. Trying to do so results in a compile-time error.\n",
    "In Python: If you use the abc module to define abstract base classes, instantiating an abstract class raises a TypeError.\n",
